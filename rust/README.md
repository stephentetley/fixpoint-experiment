# fixpoint

A port Flix's Datalog enigine to Rust. Very early stages...

The plan is to use the Arrow and Arrow Datafusion libraries to 
allow the Datalog engine to integrate with the Arrow ecosystem.
Currently not enough of the port has been implemented to 
need Arrow / Datafusion imports although they are included in the 
Cargo file.

Note - I am learning Rust by writing this project. It could be 
some time before it is working, polished, idiomatic, etc.
