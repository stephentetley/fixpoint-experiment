# fixpoint

A port Flix's Datalog enigine to Rust. Very early stages...

The plan is to use the Arrow and Arrow Datafusion libraries to 
allow the Datalog engine to integrate with the Arrow ecosystem.
However, in the first instance it is being developed with
collections from the Rust standard library.
