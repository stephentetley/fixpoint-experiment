# fixpoint-experiment

Experiments with Flix's fixpoint engine.

`flix` - a refactoring of Flix's Datalog engine. Now in the mainline flix/flix repository.

`rust` - a port Flix's Datalog engine to Rust. Very early stages. Probably stuck...

`translations` - hand translations of RAM machine programs to Python (DuckDB / Polars) and SQL.
