# fixpoint-experiment

Experiments with Flix's fixpoint engine.

`flix` - looking at generating SQL from RAM programs for fixpoint computation.

`rust` - a port Flix's Datalog engine to Rust. Very early stages. Probably stuck...

`translations` - hand translations of RAM machine programs to Python (DuckDB / Polars) and SQL.

`sql` - experiments with "in-database" SQL programming.
